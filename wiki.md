### Understanding Conflicts
When two or more mods try to change the same game file, it creates a "conflict."
**How AMO Launcher handles conflicts:**
1.	The mod lower in the **Applied Mods** list wins
2.	The **Conflicts** tab shows all conflicting files
3.	Green highlighted mods are the "winners" for each conflict
To fix conflicts, either:
•	Rearrange mods to change which one wins
•	Disable mods you don't want to use
